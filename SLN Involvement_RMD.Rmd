# Introduction

### Uterine and endometrial cancer has been increasing worldwide, with an incidence rate of 27.8% and 7.7%, respectively (American Cancer Society, 2022). Due to cancer symptoms becoming more present during later stages of cancer, it is difficult to detect and diagnose patients simply through screening. Many forms of endometrial cancer are stage IV, demonstrated by spreading to lymph nodes in the abdomen, not only the pelvis and para-ortic area regions of the woman’s body. 
### Through efforts and attempts to improve detection, diagnoses, prevention, and surveillance of uterine cancer among patients, researchers and clinicians are examining the lymph node status through sentinel lymph node excision (SLN) and ultrastaging. Sentinel lymph node exision is the process in which a sentinel lymph node is identified, removed, and examined to determine whether cancer cells are present. Ultrastaging involves additional sectioning and staining of the SLN in order to examine for low-volume metastatic disease.
### Researchers can detect potential metastatic endometrial and uterine tumors through this new health technological development, and avoid collecting data by resorting to unnecessary complete pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomies (Kang, 2020). This dataset describes the pathological features discovered of endometrial and uterine carcinomas and their association with sentinel lymph node involvement (Kang, 2020). 
### This markdown aims to depict and analyze the discovered stratified pathological features of endometrial and uterine carcinomas, and their association with sentinel lymph node excisions present among women. Specifically, we are measuring the detection of tumors present in lymph nodes, through the usage of SNL exision and ultrastaging.

Figure 1.) Lymph drainage of the uteri is complex, bilateral, and can affect lymph nodes in several areas. Nine SNL's were found and localized in the left obturator fossa (three), right obturator fossa (two), left external iliac (one), right external iliac (one), right common iliac (one), and on the junction of the right internal iliac and obturator fossa (one).

Figure 2.) (A) SLN and lymphatic vessel mapped in surgery using ICG dye and intraoperative fluorescence imaging system.  surgeon injects a radioactive substance, a blue dye, or both near the tumor. The surgeon then uses a device to detect lymph nodes that contain the radioactive substance or looks for lymph nodes that are stained with the blue dye. Once the sentinel lymph node is located, the surgeon makes a small incision in the overlying skin and removes the node. The sentinel node is then checked for the presence of cancer cells by a pathologist.(B) Common lymphatic drainage pathway of endometrial cancer. SLN's are mostly located in external iliac and obturator region and less commonly in presacral and common iliac area. (C) Three patterns of cervical injection sites of SLNM: two sides or four quadrants.

Table 1. There are 8 unique locations of these SLN lymph nodes analyzed. These include pelvic, common iliac, external iliac, inernal iliac, para-aortic, and obturator lymph nodes. The pelvic lymph nodes mainly include the external iliac, internal iliac, and obturator lymph nodes, which are below the bifurcation of the common iliac artery. These SLN lymph node locations indicate that it is a sentinel lymph node in which the cancer reached first. When a specific lymph node is recorded, this indicates detection of uterine/endometrial cancer primarily in that location. The locations of these lymph nodes are also grouped by tumor size, less than 2 mm or greater than 2 mm. 2 mm is considered one standard of detecting if the tumor has spread to lymph nodes or metastasized.

Table 2. There are primarily three assigned grades for the discovered uterine cancers: Grade I, Grade II, and Grade III. Grade I is defined as cancer cells that are 5% or less of tumour tissue that is solid tumour growth. These are well differentiated, tend to be slow growing, and less likely to spread. Grade II indicates that 6%–50% of tissue is solid tumour growth, and that the cancer cells are moderately differentiated. Grade III is the severest of all, in that more than 50% of tissue is solid tumour growth. These cells are poorly differentiated and are more likely to grow quickly and spread, than Grade I cells. The assigned grades for the affected lymph nodes are also grouped by tumor size, less than 2 mm or greater than 2 mm. 2 mm is considered one standard of detecting if the tumor has spread to lymph nodes or metastasized.

Table 3. Patient Age details the average age of the patients, along with the lowest to highest age recorded. The patient ages are also grouped by tumor size, less than 2 mm or greater than 2 mm. 2 mm is considered one standard of detecting if the tumor has spread to lymph nodes or metastasized.
